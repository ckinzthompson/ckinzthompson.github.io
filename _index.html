<p>I'm a chemistry graduate student in <a href=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html> Prof. Ruben Gonzalez's lab</a> at Columbia University.
We study the ribosome using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). </p>
<p>In particular, I'm interested in biomolecular recognition, and how this is used by nature to regulate biological processes.
For instance, my dissertation work focuses on class I release factors, which release a newly synthesized protein from the ribosome upon recognizing just three of the possible 64 codons.
Offhand, this level of discrimination seems difficult to attain, but hundreds of proteins are synthesized in a cell before a mistake is made!
How are release factors and ribosomes organized to accurately and efficiently undergo this process? </p>
<p>Some of my other research interests are in nanofabrication, stochastic processes, microscopy, machine learning, and molecular dynamics.
Please see my CV for particular publications in these areas.

 I also enjoy programming (mostly Python and C), graphic design, electronics projects, bicycles, coffee, rock climbing, and reading.

<p>While doing my undergraduate work at the University of Rochester in Chemistry, I worked with <a href='http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/esther-conwell-pioneering-professor-of-chemistry-dies-at-92/'>Prof. Esther Conwell</a> performing quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations of charge transport through DNA. </p>
<!-- <p> In the future, I would like to move into <i>in vivo</i> single-molecule imaging </p> -->
