    "# Background\n",
    "Often in an ESI-mass spectrum, you can see many peaks corresponding to different charge-states of the same molecule (i.e., with the same mass). Unfortunately, we only know the $m/z$ value of these peaks, and do not know the charge corresponding to each peak. While neighboring peaks should have a $\\pm 1$ relationship, we do not know if the first peak (i.e., highest $m/z$ we can see) is the $z=+1$ peak or some other charge. Charge determination must be performed in order to figure out the charge of each peak, and thus determine the mass of the molecule. Advanced deconvolution techinques exist for this purpose (including max-entropy based techniques), but here I'll derive an accessible formula using maximum-likelihood estimation to calculate the charge and mass of the molecule simultaneously from several peak locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nomenclature\n",
    "* A list of peaks $\\{x_i\\}$. This is just several $m/z$ values you have identified as belonging to the same series in a mass spectrum (i.e., via their common envelope).\n",
    "* A reference index, $0$. Pick one, it doesn't matter which -- it could be the largest, or the first.\n",
    "* The mass of the reference molecule, $m_0$. Drop the $0$ for ease of typing ($m$). \n",
    "* The charge of the reference molecule, $z_0$. Drop the $0$ for ease of typing ($z$). \n",
    "* $n_i$ is the index relative to the reference peak (i.e., $n_0=0$, $n_1=1$, $n_{-1}=-1, ...$).\n",
    "* $\\langle X \\rangle \\equiv \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "Peaks are located at: $$x_i = \\frac{m_0+n_i}{z_0+n_i}$$"
