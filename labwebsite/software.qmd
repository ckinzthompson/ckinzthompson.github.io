time-series Modeling, Analysis, and Visualization ENvironment (tMAVEN) is software for post-processing, modeling, and generating publication quality figures for smFRET data. It was made in collaboration with the [Gonzalez lab](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html).

Bayesian Inference for the Analysis of Sub-temporal-resolution Data (BIASD) is a method to temporal resolve kinetics any single-molecule time series, even if those kintics are orders of magnitude faster than the time resolution of the technique.
:::

* Read the first paper: [Increasing the Time Resolution of Single-Molecule Experiments with Bayesian Inference](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2017.11.3741)
* Read the next paper: [Entropic control of the free-energy landscape of an archetypal biomolecular machine](10.1073/pnas.2220591120)
* See the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ckinzthompson/biasd)
