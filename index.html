<p>I'm chemistry graduate student in <a href=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html> Prof. Ruben Gonzalez's lab</a> at Columbia University.
We study the ribosome using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET)! </p>
<p>In particular, I'm interested in biomolecular recognition, and how this is used by nature to regulate biological processes.
For instance, my dissertation work focuses on class I release factors which release a newly synthesized protein from the ribosome upon recognizing just three of the possible 64 codons.
Offhand, this level of discrimination seems difficult to attain, but hundreds of proteins are synthesized in a cell before a mistake is made!
How are release factors and ribosomes organized to so accurately and efficiently undergo this process? </p>
<br>
<p>I'm also interested in nanofabrication, stochastic processes, microscopies, and molecular dynamics.</p>
<p> I've had wonderful </p>
<p>While doing my undergraduate work at the University of Rochester in Chemistry, I worked with <a href='http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/esther-conwell-pioneering-professor-of-chemistry-dies-at-92/'>Prof. Esther Conwell </a> performing quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations of charge transport through DNA. </p>
<br> I would like to move into <i>in vivo</i> RNA imaging
